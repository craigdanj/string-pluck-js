# Guitar Pluck

A dependency-free browser instrument built with the Web Audio API. `guitar-pluck.js` implements a Karplus–Strong plucked string; `index.html` is a responsive, playable demo.

## Try it

Put `index.html` and `guitar-pluck.js` in the same folder and open `index.html` in a modern browser. Click a string or press 1–6; press Space to strum. Audio starts after a user interaction, as browsers require.

## Use it in a page

```html
<script src="guitar-pluck.js"></script>
<button id="play">Pluck A</button>
<script>
  const guitar = new GuitarPluck({ decay: 2.4, brightness: 0.7 });
  document.querySelector("#play").addEventListener("click", async () => {
    await guitar.resume();
    guitar.pluck(110); // A2, 110 Hz
  });
</script>
```

`new GuitarPluck({ context?, destination?, attack?, decay?, brightness?, damping?, pickPosition?, volume? })` accepts an optional existing `AudioContext` and destination node. `pluck(frequency, velocity = 1, overrides = {})` plays a note and returns its voice; `setParams({...})` updates subsequent plucks; `stopAll()` silences active voices; `dispose()` releases nodes and closes the context only if the plugin created it. Values are clamped to safe ranges. Frequency must be 40–2000 Hz.

| Parameter      | Range       | Default | Effect                                   |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `attack`       | 0.001–0.5 s | 0.008   | Fade-in time                             |
| `decay`        | 0.15–8 s    | 2.2     | Approximate sustain length               |
| `brightness`   | 0–1         | 0.65    | Excitation noise and low-pass cutoff     |
| `damping`      | 0–1         | 0.28    | High-frequency loss in the feedback loop |
| `pickPosition` | 0.05–0.5    | 0.22    | Pluck location along the string          |
| `volume`       | 0–1         | 0.7     | Note level                               |

The plugin generates a short buffer for every pluck. It is suited to interactive demos and modest polyphony; very long decays and heavy polyphony increase CPU and memory use. This synthesizes a string rather than using guitar samples, so it does not model a guitar body, fret noise, or realistic articulation.
